            <p class="work_description">Lead Product Designer 2018 - 2019</p>
            <p class="work_description">Jammer is a mobile music platform with a big innovation: songs are no longer fixed tracks, but interactive experiences that you can play, remix, record and share. Their flagship app allowed users to play songs like an instrument, with each button triggering parts of the song. My time there included helping the company continue to ship new features for their iOS app, as well as creating a new Artist Portal and Jammer Board Maker for users. On top of product design, I also helped other departments with their needs such as branding and marketing collateral for new music releases and promotions. Jammer featured music by major label artists such as Ariana Grande, Kanye West, Chance the Rapper, and Justin Bieber.</p>

          <p class="subheader_b">Product Initiatives</p>
          <p class="work_description">Goals were mainly centered around early stage user growth and retention. Some projects I led were introducing a recording feature to the iOS apps, and a social graph that allowed users to connect with and browse their friend's shared recordings. Other smaller projects included improving the marketplace experience for purchasing Jammer Boards, and major usability updates to the search and browse UX.</p>

          <p class="subheader_b">Jammer Studio / Artist Portal:</p>
          <p class="work_description">Another big problem to solve was getting more music on Jammer.  I led efforts to research and build a consumer facing Artist Portal–a web and mobile product that would allow musicians to make and publish their own Jammer Boards (a process that was initially done as a white glove service.) We tested extensively with artists already on the platform as well as new users. A big challenge here was to meet all the techincal features pro artists wanted, while also making it incredibly easy for amateur musicians to use.</p></br>

            <p class="work_description">Kiyo was a personal media app, designed so you can engage meaningfully with the people who mean something to you, rather than browse #content by #influencers. Kiyo was owned by List App, a startup founded by BJ Novak. I was hired to help lead the design for their new iOS product, a step away from the norm when it comes to socializing online. I was responsible for most product decisions from branding, to prototyping and implementation. Apple featured the app in their promoted section, "New Apps We Love" when it launched.</p>

I was the first employee, and helped grow the company and product through 3 rounds of funding with a wide array of design and product initiatives. My approach for design was based on the overall goal of bringing transparency to the industry of alternative lending, as well as transforming the arduous process of applying for financing into something that felt quick and seamless. Products decisions were guided by mixpanel analytics, various user-testing techniques, and the intuition of a talented design focused product team. In 2018, <a target="_blank" class="clickable js-animate-color" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/donnafuscaldo/2019/08/30/fundera-in-growth-mode-without-the-need-for-vc-funding/#3f0022421d1d">Forbes reported that Fundera did $15.6 million in annual revnue.</a></p>

I joined as the first design hire, when the company was an SMS based app with series A funding. Over the course of 3 years, I created and evolved a visual brand, and developed consistent user experiences across multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry, and web. Rapid user growth and engagement was driven by keen product research, user-testing, and rapid/consistant development releases. GroupMe was <a target="_blank" class="clickable js-animate-color" href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/21/skype-to-acquire-year-old-group-messaging-service-groupme/">acquired by Skype/Microsoft</a> in 2012.

The goal was to share with Skype, and their design teams, improvements we thought could be made to their app, as well as give the impression we were eager to begin integrating Skype and GroupMe's technologies and products. Sort of a "We're excited to join the family" gift. The project was presented to Skype's CEO, Tony Bates.</p>

            <p class="work_description">Lead Product Designer 2018 - 2019</p>
            <p class="work_description">Jammer is a mobile music platform with a big innovation: songs are no longer fixed tracks, but interactive experiences that you can play, remix, record and share. Their flagship app allowed users to play songs like an instrument, with each button triggering parts of the song. My time there included helping the company continue to ship new features for their iOS app, as well as creating a new Artist Portal and Jammer Board Maker for users. On top of product design, I also helped other departments with their needs such as branding and marketing collateral for new music releases and promotions. Jammer featured music by major label artists such as Ariana Grande, Kanye West, Chance the Rapper, and Justin Bieber.</p>

          <p class="subheader_b">Product Initiatives</p>
          <p class="work_description">Goals were mainly centered around early stage user growth and retention. Some projects I led were introducing a recording feature to the iOS apps, and a social graph that allowed users to connect with and browse their friend's shared recordings. Other smaller projects included improving the marketplace experience for purchasing Jammer Boards, and major usability updates to the search and browse UX.</p>

          <p class="subheader_b">Jammer Studio / Artist Portal:</p>
          <p class="work_description">Another big problem to solve was getting more music on Jammer.  I led efforts to research and build a consumer facing Artist Portal–a web and mobile product that would allow musicians to make and publish their own Jammer Boards (a process that was initially done as a white glove service.) We tested extensively with artists already on the platform as well as new users. A big challenge here was to meet all the techincal features pro artists wanted, while also making it incredibly easy for amateur musicians to use.</p>

I was the first employee, and helped grow the company and product through 3 rounds of funding with a wide array of design and product initiatives. My approach for design was based on the overall goal of bringing transparency to the industry of alternative lending, as well as transforming the arduous process of applying for financing into something that felt quick and seamless. Products decisions were guided by mixpanel analytics, various user-testing techniques, and the intuition of a talented design focused product team.

I joined as the first design hire, when the company was an SMS based app with series A funding. Over the course of 3 years, I created and evolved a visual brand, and developed consistent user experiences across multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry, and web. Rapid user growth and engagement was driven by keen product research, user-testing, and rapid/consistant development releases. GroupMe was <a target="_blank" class="clickable js-animate-color" href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/21/skype-to-acquire-year-old-group-messaging-service-groupme/">acquired by Skype/Microsoft</a> in 2011. Today, the product still reflects a lot the work of the talented founding team, and currently sits in the top 10 'Free Social Networking' category in the Apple App Store. </p>
